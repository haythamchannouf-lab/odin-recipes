    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned . </li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 and 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C. </li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 and 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 and 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up. </li>
